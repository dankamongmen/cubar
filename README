Requirements:

 - GCC 4.2 or higher
 - CUDA libraries and header files (from NVIDIA device driver)
 - CUDA SDK libraries (from NVIDIA CUDA SDK)
 - libpci libraries and header files

I've tested using CUDA 2.3+, on device drivers 196.x.x+.

Q: I get weird compiler errors (exec failure for cc1plus, etc)!
Q: I get weird compiler errors (functions declared 'static' but never defined)
Q: I get weird compiler errors (inline functions declared 'weak')
A: Do you have multiple gcc/g++/libstdc++ versions installed? nvcc doesn't
   (at this time) like gcc's newer than 4.3. I work around this via:

	export COMPILER_PATH:=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.3

    in my Makefile.local.
